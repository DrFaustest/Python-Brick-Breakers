# Brick Breaker Game

## Description
This is a Brick Breaker game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The game is a modern take on the classic arcade game, where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. Each level presents a unique challenge with bricks that become progressively harder to break. The game features an intuitive physics system, giving a realistic feel to the ball's movement and collisions.

## Features
- **Brick Class:** Creates various bricks with increasing difficulty levels.
- **Ball Class:** Manages the ball's speed, direction, and interactions with bricks and walls.
- **Paddle Class:** A player-controlled paddle with a vector visualization to predict the ball's trajectory.
- **Level Class:** Generates different levels with a base play space, adding bricks, obstacles, and power-ups.
- **Power-Ups:** Enhancements to make the game more engaging (planned feature).
